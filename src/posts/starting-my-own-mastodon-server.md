I never thought of leaving Twitter, but I did. I never thought of starting my own Mastodon server, but I did. I never thought of writing a blog post about it, but I am.

Today, I started my own [Mastodon](https://social.notweet.de/@Gurpreet) server and looking forward see how it works. People to don't know what Mastodon is, it is written as free and open-source software (FOSS) for federated micro-blogging, which means anyone can spin-up their own instance and contribute the to code repository.

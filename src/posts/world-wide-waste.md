It is very simple to buy a new computer today and start dumping files on it. But have you ever thought what the plan would be to delete those files, or are those files going to be stored permanently on your hard drive?

I recently finished a book called [World Wide Waste](https://gerrymcgovern.com/world-wide-waste/) by [Gerry McGovern](https://gerrymcgovern.com/). The author helps organizations reduce data waste by designing simpler, lighter, and more environmentally friendly websites and apps.

## What is Digital waste?

**Digital is Physical**, it is quite important to understand whatever you download/upload on web is all impacting our planet earth. Single byte causes load on the server which generates COÂ². I often do research on to benchmarking my projects on tools where I get information around my carbon footprints. You can check my previous article "[7 ways to make your website more accessible and sustainable](/posts/7-ways-to-make-your-website-more-accessible-and-sustainable/)" to get some idea around how Digital is playing role in Sustainability and how it can be improved.

## What is net zero?

## Sustainability Goals?
